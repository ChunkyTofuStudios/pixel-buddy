**Introduction**

This page is designed to give Pixel Buddy users control over their own data. Please continue reading to better understand our data handling practices. Please also visit our [Privacy Policy](https://chunkytofustudios.com/pixel-buddy/privacy-policy/) page.

**Intent**

Pixel Buddy is developed by indie developers who believe people own their personal data and have full control over it. We will never sell your data to 3rd parties. You have full control of your Pixel Buddy data and we are here to help.

**Account Deletion**

If you would like to delete your Pixel Buddy account please navigate to the `Settings -> Feedback` section of the app and submit the form requesting account deletion. We will delete your account within 60 days and send you a confirmation email if you provide one in the form. If you are unable to use the in-app Feedback form please email us at chunkytofustudios@gmail.com and we will try to help after confirming your ownership of the account.

When you delete your account we will remove all user data including:

* User ID and Advertising ID
* Artworks you've uploaded
* Painting progress

We are not able to delete:

* Anonymized usage data

**Data Deletion**

If you'd rather keep your account but would like us to delete some parts of your personal daya please navigate to the `Settings -> Feedback` section of the app and submit the form requesting data deletion. In your request you can specify which type of data to be removed, options are:

* Artworks you've uploaded
* Painting progress

We will delete the requested data within 60 days and send you a confirmation email if you provide one in the form.
